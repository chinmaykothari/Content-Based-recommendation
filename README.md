# 🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on their content similarity, leveraging TF-IDF vectorization for text data. It utilizes the **TMDB 5000 movie dataset**, a widely used resource containing movie details like genres, cast, crew, and overviews.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing and model development
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** for movie information

## 📂 Dataset
The system uses the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset**, which includes:
- Movie details (title, genres, overview, cast, crew, etc.)
- Metadata essential for similarity calculation

- Dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata


## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to recommend movies to users based on the similarity between movie overviews, genres, cast, and crew using content-based filtering techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **Content Similarity**: Recommends movies based on plot overview, cast, crew, and genres.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts movie overviews to numerical vectors based on the frequency of words.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies using cosine distance.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. **Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, and text features like the movie overview, cast, and genres are transformed into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
2. **Vectorization**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is applied to the movie overview to convert text into vectors.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity is calculated between movies to find the most similar ones based on their content.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on the similarity scores, movies with the highest similarity to a selected movie are recommended.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
    cd movie-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 📈 Results
The model performs well in suggesting movies that are closely related in terms of plot and genre, providing a personalized user experience.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Incorporate user reviews and ratings to improve recommendations.
- Implement hybrid recommendation techniques combining collaborative filtering with content-based filtering.
- Deploy the system using a cloud platform like AWS or Azure.
